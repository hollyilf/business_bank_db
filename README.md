Code First Girls Data and SQL Final Project

In July 2021, I completed the Code First Girls Introduction to Data and SQL course. The course covered: 

-	SQL programming language 
-	Database design and management
-	Data analysis and manipulation
-	Data visualisation 

This repository contains my final project that I presented to our class in order to graduate from the course.  The project had to cover all of the core requirements and 2-3 of the advanced options. 

Core requirements: 

•	Create relational DB of your choice with minimum 5 tables
•	Set Primary and Foreign Key constraints to create relations between the tables
•	Using any type of the joins create a view that combines multiple tables in a logical way
•	Create a stored function that can be applied to a query in your DB
•	Prepare an example query with a subquery to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis 
•	Create DB diagram where all table relations are shown

Advanced requirements: 

•	Create a stored procedure and demonstrate how it runs
•	Create a trigger and demonstrate how it runs
•	Create an event and demonstrate how it runs
•	Create a view that uses at least 3-4 base tables; prepare and demonstrate a query that uses the view to produce a logically arranged result set for analysis.
•	Prepare an example query with group by and having to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis
